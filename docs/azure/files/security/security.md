## Microsoft Defender for Cloud

| Plan | Covers | Key Feature |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Defender for Servers** | VMs, Arc servers | Vulnerability assessment, JIT VM access |
| **Defender for Storage** | Blob, Files, ADLS | Malware scanning, anomaly detection |
| **Defender for SQL** | Azure SQL, SQL Server | SQL injection detection, anomalous access |
| **Defender for Containers** | AKS, ACR, Arc K8s | Image scanning, runtime threat detection |
| **Defender for App Service** | Web apps | Threat detection, malicious domain alerts |
| **Defender for Key Vault** | Key Vault | Suspicious access pattern alerts |
| **Defender for DNS** | DNS layer | Detect C2 communication |
| **Defender CSPM** | Cloud posture | Attack path analysis, governance |

> **⚠️ Deprecation warning:** "Security Center" and "Azure Defender" are legacy names.
> The current product is **Microsoft Defender for Cloud**. Older exam questions may still
> use the former names.

> **Exam tip (AZ-500):** JIT VM Access (under Defender for Servers) locks down management
> ports and opens them only on approved request; choose it when the requirement mentions
> reducing the attack surface on VM management ports.

## Azure Key Vault

| Feature | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| **Secrets** | Connection strings, passwords, API keys |
| **Keys** | Encryption keys (RSA, EC) — HSM-backed option |
| **Certificates** | Manage TLS/SSL lifecycle |
| **Soft Delete** | Retain deleted objects for 7–90 days |
| **Purge Protection** | Prevent permanent deletion during retention |
| **RBAC vs Access Policies** | RBAC preferred (granular, Azure AD-native) |
| **Private Endpoint** | Restrict Key Vault to VNet-only access |

> Exam tip: Always use **Managed Identity** to access Key Vault — never store credentials in app config.

## Key Vault Access Models

| Service | Access Model | Audit | Granularity | Key Feature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Key Vault** | Vault Access Policies (legacy) | Per-vault log; no per-operation identity trail | Coarse — get/list/set apply to all secrets | Simple setup; max 1024 policies per vault |
| **Key Vault** | Azure RBAC | Full Azure Activity Log + Entra audit trail | Fine-grained — role assignment per secret/key/cert | Entra-native; supports PIM, Conditional Access |

> **⚠️ Deprecation warning:** Vault Access Policies are the legacy authorization model for
> Key Vault. Microsoft recommends migrating to **Azure RBAC** for new and existing vaults.
> RBAC provides Entra-native granularity, PIM support, and a unified audit trail.

> **Exam tip:** Choose Azure RBAC for Key Vault when the requirement mentions
> Entra integration, Privileged Identity Management (PIM), per-resource
> granularity, or migration away from legacy Access Policies.

Use **Managed Identity** bound to an Azure RBAC role (e.g. Key Vault Secrets User)
as the credential-free pattern — no secrets stored in application configuration.

> **Exam tip:** Access Key Vault from code using `DefaultAzureCredential` (azure-identity) with `SecretClient` (azure-keyvault-secrets). No credentials are stored in application configuration — `DefaultAzureCredential` resolves through: environment variables → workload identity → managed identity → Visual Studio → Azure CLI → Azure PowerShell → interactive browser. In production the managed identity is used automatically; locally the Azure CLI credential is used — the same code runs in both environments without modification.

> **Exam tip:** Certificate auto-rotation: Key Vault monitors certificate expiry and triggers renewal via the configured CA issuer (DigiCert or GlobalSign) or a self-signed renewal policy. The application retrieves the updated certificate on the next polling interval or receives a near-expiry notification via Event Grid (`Microsoft.KeyVault.CertificateNearExpiry`). The app does not need to be redeployed — it re-reads the certificate from Key Vault on the next request or on the Event Grid event.

## App Configuration

| Service | Type | Best For | Key Feature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| App Configuration Feature Flags | Feature | Runtime feature toggling without redeployment | Boolean flags with audience-targeting filters; integrated with .NET, Java, Python SDKs |
| App Configuration Key Vault References | Configuration | Centralised secret consumption without copying secret values | Stores only the Key Vault secret URI; actual value fetched from Key Vault at runtime |
| App Configuration Label-based Config | Configuration | Environment-specific configuration (dev, staging, prod) in one store | Labels act as a filter on key-value pairs; the app selects the label at startup |

> **Exam tip:** App Configuration Key Vault references never copy or cache the secret value inside App Configuration — only the Key Vault URI is stored. When the secret rotates in Key Vault, the updated value is returned on the next runtime fetch without any change to App Configuration. This is the recommended pattern for secret rotation transparency.

## Encryption

| Type | Description | Service |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Encryption at rest** | Data encrypted on disk | Default in Azure Storage, SQL, etc. |
| **CMK (Customer-Managed Keys)** | You control key in Key Vault | Stricter compliance, storage + SQL |
| **PMK (Platform-Managed Keys)** | Microsoft manages key | Default, lower admin overhead |
| **Double Encryption** | Two layers of encryption | Azure Storage, Disks |
| **Encryption in transit** | TLS enforced | All Azure services |
| **Azure Disk Encryption** | BitLocker (Windows) / dm-crypt (Linux) | VM OS and data disks |
| **SSE (Server-Side Encryption)** | Storage service encrypts before writing | Azure Blob, Files, Queues |

## Policy & Compliance

| Concept | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Azure Policy** | Enforce, audit, or remediate resource configurations |
| **Policy Initiative** | Group of policies (e.g., CIS benchmark) |
| **Deny Effect** | Block non-compliant resource creation |
| **Audit Effect** | Flag non-compliance without blocking |
| **DeployIfNotExists** | Auto-remediate — deploy missing configs |
| **Modify Effect** | Auto-add tags or properties |
| **Compliance Dashboard** | See % compliance across subscriptions |
| **Regulatory Compliance** | Pre-built initiatives: NIST, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS |

> Exam tip: **DeployIfNotExists** requires a managed identity for the policy assignment to execute remediation.

## Authentication & Password Security

| Feature | Description | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **MFA** | Multi-factor authentication | All users, especially admins |
| **Passwordless** | FIDO2 key, Microsoft Authenticator, Windows Hello | Zero-password auth |
| **Conditional Access** | Policy-based access decisions | Enforce MFA by location/risk/device |
| **Identity Protection** | Risk-based sign-in/user risk policies | Auto-block risky sign-ins |
| **SSPR (Self-Service Password Reset)** | Users reset their own passwords | Reduce helpdesk load |
| **Password Protection** | Block weak/known-bad passwords | On-prem AD + Azure AD |
| **PIM (Privileged Identity Management)** | Just-in-time privileged access | Admin roles activated on demand |
| **Access Reviews** | Periodic review of group/role membership | Compliance, least-privilege enforcement |

## Microsoft Sentinel

| Component | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Data Connectors** | Ingest logs from Azure, M365, 3rd party |
| **Analytics Rules** | Detect threats from log patterns |
| **Playbooks (Logic Apps)** | Auto-respond to incidents |
| **Workbooks** | Visualize security data |
| **UEBA** | User and entity behavior analytics |
| **Threat Intelligence** | Feed-based IOC matching |

> Sentinel = SIEM + SOAR. Defender for Cloud = CSPM + workload protection. They integrate but serve different roles.

> **Exam tip (AZ-500):** Sentinel is a cloud-native SIEM + SOAR; Defender for
> Cloud is CSPM + workload protection. AZ-500 questions that mention "incident
> response automation" or "playbook" point to Sentinel. Questions that mention
> "secure score" or "recommendations" point to Defender for Cloud.

## Defender for Cloud

| Service | Layer | Scope | Use Case | Key Feature |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Defender CSPM (Free)** | Posture | Subscription | Secure Score, recommendations | Always on; no cost |
| **Defender CSPM (Paid)** | Posture | Subscription | Advanced posture, attack paths | Governance rules, regulatory compliance |
| **Defender for Servers** | Workload | VM/Arc | Threat detection on VMs | MDE integration, vulnerability assessment |
| **Defender for Storage** | Workload | Storage Account | Malware scanning, anomaly detection | Per-storage-account enablement |

> **Exam tip:** Enabling Defender for Cloud at the subscription level automatically covers all existing and future resources. Use the "Enhanced Security" toggle per workload plan to control cost.
